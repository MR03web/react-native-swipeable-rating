# react-native-swipeable-rating
Star rating component with support for swipe and / or touch selection

![Example](/example.gif?raw=true)


## Usage

`react-native-vector-icons` package is required, [set it up](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-vector-icons) if you haven't already.

install > `npm i react-native-swipeable-rating`

### Basic example

```javascript
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { View } from 'react-native';
import SwipeableRating from 'react-native-swipeable-rating';

class MyStarRating extends Component {
  state = {
    rating: 0
  }

  handleRating = (rating) => {
    this.setState({rating});
  }

  render(){
    return(
      <View style={{marginHorizontal: 30}}>
        <SwipeableRating
          rating={this.state.rating}
          size={32}
          gap={4}
          onPress={this.handleRating}
          xOffset={30}
        />
      </View>
    )
  }
}
```

**See the [full example app](https://github.com/renrizzolo/react-native-swipeable-rating-demo)**

There are a few different ways the component can be used:
- The above example works with swiping and tapping on individual stars.
- `rating={n}`, `swipeable={false}` and no `onPress` will make it a dumb/static component that displays a rating.
- `swipeable={false}` with an `onPress` function will make the individual stars a tappable `TouchableOpacity`.
- if you use `allowHalves` you will also need to change `minRating` to `0.5`

|xOffset                    |number       |0                 |The offset from the left of the screen to the start of the component (ignore if `swipeable={false}`)      |no but you will almost definitely need to change it! |
|style                      |object       |                  |Styles the rating container                     |          |
|color                      |string       |'crimson'         |Color applied to the default star icon          |          |
|emptyColor                 |string       |'crimson'         |Color applied to the default empty star icon    |          |
|size                       |number       |24                |The size applied to the default icons           |          |
|gap                        |number       |0                 |marginRight applied to the default icons        |          |
|minRating                  |number       |1                 |The minimum rating to allow                     |          |
|maxRating                  |number       |5                 |The maximum rating to allow / amount of stars to display   |          |
|allowHalves                |boolean      |false             |Allow ratings to go up in increments of 0.5 instead of 1                         |          |
|filledIcon                 |string or function |'star'        |The MaterialIcons icon to use for the filled star OR your custom component function (receives `size`, `gap`, number args)      |          |
|halfFilledIcon             |string or function |'star-half'   |The MaterialIcons icon to use for the half filled star OR your custom component function (receives `size`, `gap`, number args) |          |
|emptyIcon                  |string or function |'star-border' |The MaterialIcons icon to use for the empty star OR your custom component function (receives `size`, `gap`, number args)       |          |

You must make your custom icon components `size` (+ `gap`, if you use it) total width, so the correct swipe distances can be calculated.

`size`, `gap`, `color`, `emptyColor`, `n` (the icon's rating number (index) beginning at 1) are passed to the custom icon functions for convenience.
